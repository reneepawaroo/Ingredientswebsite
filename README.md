# Ingredientswebsite
Plug in your top ingredients and get food inspo

This is a website designed to give you the best recipes to take care of your cravings. Suppose you really liked apples and wanted to make something with those as the main star of the dish, but you want some ideas. Sure you can search Google and probably then browse multiple websites. That takes time. Instead wouldn't it be better to plug in "apples" into a search and have the recipes pop up where apples are the key ingredient. 

There are also handy filters to make sure your search results meet your dietary restrictions and meal type (ie. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert).
