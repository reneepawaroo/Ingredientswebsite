# Ingredientswebsite
Plug in your top ingredients and get food inspiration

This is a website designed to give you the best recipes for the few ingredients you want to highlight. It works where you plug in up to 3 ingredients in a search and it will bring up the best recipes where those ingredients are the key ingredients of the dish. For example, suppose you love apples and want to make a dish that highlights them, you can use this site to search "apples" and the top recipes for apple dishes will pop up on cards below. 

There are also handy filters to make sure your search results meet your dietary restrictions and meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert).
